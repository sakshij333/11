Query:
create table lib(rollno int,name varchar(20),status varchar(20));

insert into lib values(1,'Gaurav','R');
insert into lib values(2,'Pratik','I');
insert into lib values(3,'Seeta','I');
insert into lib values(4,'Getta','R');

create table liba(rollno int,name varchar(20),status varchar(20));

create or replace trigger library
before delete or update on lib
REFERENCING old as o new as n
for each row
begin
insert into liba values(:o.rollno, :o.name, :o.status);
end;

delete from lib where rollno=1; 
delete from lib where rollno=2;
update lib set rollno=1 where rollno=3;

After delete Query:

liba table:

ROLLNO	NAME	STATUS
1	Gaurav	R
2	Pratik	I
3	Seeta	I
